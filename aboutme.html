  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p> To make my website accessible to all users I think it's important for me to use colors that are appealing to the eye and easy to read. Also different language options would be nice in case a person doesn't speak English.</p>
  <p>What I found cool about other people's webpages were moving backgrounds. I also liked how some people had different cursors. They used certain codes to do these things.</p>
  <p>I'm proud that I am now familiar with HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about making my own webpage.</p>
