  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p> To make my website accessible to all users I think it's important for me to use colors that are appealing to the eye and easy to read. Also different language options would be nice in case a person doesn't speak English.</p>
  <p>What I found cool about other people's webpages were moving backgrounds. I also liked how some people had different cursors. They used certain codes to do these things.</p>
  <p>I'm proud that I am now familiar with HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about making my own webpage.</p>
  <h1>Reflection:Core 4</h1>
  <h2>Technical Definitions</h2>
  <p>Variables hold the place of a value. You can use the equal sign to assign variables.</p>
  <p>Loops make a code run multiple times repeatedly. The types of loops are while loop, for loop, and nested loops.</p>
  <p>Conditionals let you change how a program is working using if then, else, and elif statements.</p>
  <p>Functions are code that carry out a certain action. Function keywords begin with def.</p>
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p> A list is a type of sequence. They are made up of elements. You can slice them or extend them. Tuples cannot be manipulated. Tuples use parenthesis and lists use brackets.</p>
  <p>I liked working with my group. Our topic was on slicing lists. I liked how we worked together and presented the project to each other within our group. It helped me understand better.</p>
  <p>I like working on the Obamicon because I think it looks cool. I like how my picture was able to change because I manipulated the pixels.</p>
